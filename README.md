# Triviality
http://artnc.github.io/triviality

Triviality is a free online game that I designed and coded one winter break in order to learn React.

Inspired by *Classic Trivia* and *What's the Lyric*, Triviality is a question-and-answer quiz app that pulls data from the [J! Archive](http://j-archive.com/) via [jService](http://jservice.io/). It's optimized for the Amazon Fire TV but also works with keyboard, mouse, and/or touchscreen.
