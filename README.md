Inspired by _Classic Trivia_ and _What's the Lyric_, Triviality is a question-and-answer quiz app that pulls data from the [J! Archive](https://j-archive.com/) via [Cluebase](https://cluebase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It's optimized for the Amazon Fire TV but also works with keyboard, mouse, and/or touchscreen.
